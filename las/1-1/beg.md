(Represent a problem using a regular model of computation.)

(a) Give a finite automata (deterministic or non-deterministic) that recognizes the following language over the alphabet $$\Sigma = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$$:

$$
L = \{\, w \mid \text{The third character of \( w \) is a \( 1 \)} \,\}
$$

(_Note_: for this problem, you may upload a diagram of your finite automata or provide it as ASCII art in the textbox below.)

(b) Write a regular expression that also recognizes $$L$$.
