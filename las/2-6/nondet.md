(Describe the practical relationships between various time and space complexity classes.)

(a) Observe that a non-deterministic finite automata $$N$$ is not a "real" machine (modulo the Automata Processor that we studied in a prior demo). To simulate $$N$$, we must apply the subset transformation on $$N$$ to obtain an equivalent deterministic finite automata $$D$$. Based on this, what is the time and space complexity of simulating an NFA?

(b) In general, when we attempt to simulate a non-deterministic machine, what kind of performance blow-up can we expect? In a few sentences, describe where does this blow-up comes from.
