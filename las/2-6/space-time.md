(Describe the practical relationships between various time and space complexity classes.)

We observed in class that if a Turing machine takes $$O(f(n))$$ time, it can take no more than $$O(f(n))$$ space. What do we know, if anything, if, instead, the Turing machine takes $$O(f(n))$$ space? In particular, can we establish any lower or upper bounds on the time complexity of the Turing machine? Explain your answer in a few sentences.
