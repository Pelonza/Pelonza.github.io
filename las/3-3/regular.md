(Prove the undecidability of a given problem through Rice's Theorem.)

Consider the following language $$L$$:

$$
L = \{\, \langle M \rangle \mid \text{The language of Turing machine \( M \) is regular} \,\}.
$$

Can we prove that this language is undecidable via Rice's Theorem? If so, use Rice's Theorem to show it is undecidable. If not, explain why in a few sentences.
