(Prove closure and algorithmic properties of Turing machines.)

Recall that the intersection of two languages $$L_1$$ and $$L_2$$, written $$L_1 \cap L_2$$, is the set of strings that are both in $$L_1$$ and $$L_2$$. Show that if $$L_1$$ and $$L_2$$ are both decidable, then the intersection of $$L_1$$ and $$L_2$$ is also decidable.
