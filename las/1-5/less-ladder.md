(Represent a problem using a Turing machine.)

Give a (textual) implementation-level description of a TM that recognizes the following language over $$\Sigma = \{\, a, b, c \,\}$$.

$$L = \{\, a^i b^j c^k \mid 0 \leq i \leq j \leq k \,\}$$.

Make sure in your description to describe any pre-processing you do to the tape, _e.g._, shifting and marking, as well as the precise movement of the head throughout the operation of the machine.
