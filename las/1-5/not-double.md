(Represent a problem using a Turing machine.)

Give a (textual) implementation-level description of a TM that recognizes the following language over $$\Sigma = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$$.

$$L = \{\, w \mid \text{\( w \) does not contain twice as many 1s as 0s} \,\}$$.

Make sure in your description to describe any pre-processing you do to the tape, _e.g._, shifting and marking, as well as the precise movement of the head throughout the operation of the machine.
