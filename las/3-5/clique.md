(Describe practical problem solving strategies for dealing with intractable problems.)

Recall from a previous LA the following scenario: consider that you are working at a social network company and you are tasked with the following problem:

> Given a social network graph where the nodes are people and the edges are friend relationships, find largest collection of people that are all mutually friends with each other.

Suppose that you can't quit your job. Recalling the three pillars of the intractability problem, choose one of the pillars to compromise on, and describe a high-level strategy to solve this problem with this compromise in mind. Describe the pros and cons of compromising on this pillar and the plausibility of this approach in real life.

(_Note_: I am interested less in whether you pick a "correct" approach and more interested in seeing your rationale and justification based on our discussion of approximation.)
