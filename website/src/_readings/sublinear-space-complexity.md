Today, we'll look at sublinear space complexity, the classes $\mathsf{L}$ and $\mathsf{NL}$.
Curiously enough, we must adjust our model of computation slightly to be able to accurately capture what we mean by "less than linear space."

+   Ch 8.4 "The Classes L and NL" (pp. 348) up to Chapter 8.6 "NL Equals CoNL" (pp. 353).
