# Classical NP-Complete Problems

We'll continue our discussion of NP-completeness by studying mapping reductions of classic NP-complete problems in detail.

+ Review Sipser 7.5 "Additional NP-Complete Problems".

**Reading Problem (Reductions)**

Complete and submit one of the two NP-complete problems introduced in last class's daily:

1. Prove that vertex cover ($\mathsf{COVER}$) is NP-complete.
2. Sipser 7.28.  Prove that the card puzzle problem ($\mathsf{PUZZLE}$) is NP-complete.

Remember to prove both parts of the definition of NP-completeness: membership in NP and NP-hardness.
Make sure that you also argue both directions of the reduction's correctness condition.
