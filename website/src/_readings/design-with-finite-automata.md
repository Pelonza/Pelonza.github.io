In today's class we'll spend the day looking at different considerations when designing computation with finite automata.
In particular, we'll look at:

+   Establishing _invariants_ about states.
+   Utilizing _patterns_ of states to accomplish common tasks in automata.

For today, review the _Designing Finite Automata_ section of Sipser chapter 1 (pp. 41â€“43).

::: exercise
**Reading Problem (Corners)**

Design well-formed DFAs over the alphabet $\Sigma = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$ that recognize the languages:

+   $L_1 = \emptyset$, _i.e._, the empty set of strings.
+   $L_1 = \Sigma^*$, _i.e._, all possible strings generated from $\Sigma$.
