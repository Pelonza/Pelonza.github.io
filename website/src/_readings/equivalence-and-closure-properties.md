title: "Equivalence and Closure Properties"

With two formal models of computation in-hand, we'll now talk about two important properties of these models:

+   An _equivalence_ property, stating that, perhaps surprisingly, deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata are equivalent in power!
+   _Closure properties_ that express that certain operations over regular languages, _e.g._, language union, produce regular languages as a result.

## Sipser Reading

+   (Re-)read chapter 1.1 "The Regular Operations" to the end of 1.1.
+   Read chapter 1.2 "Equivalence of NFAs and DFAs" and "Closure Under the Regular Operations" to the end of 1.2.

::: exercise
**Reading Problem (Restatement)**: closely follow the equivalence of NFA and DFA argument in the reading.
Do your best to replicate the proof on your own, minimally referring to the text.
