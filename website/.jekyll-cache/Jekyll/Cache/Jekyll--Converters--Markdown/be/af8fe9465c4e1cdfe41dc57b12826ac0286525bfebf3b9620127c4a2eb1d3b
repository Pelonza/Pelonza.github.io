<p>We’ll continue our discussion of NP-completeness by studying mapping reductions of classic NP-complete problems in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review Sipser 7.5 “Additional NP-Complete Problems”.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Reading Problem (Reductions)</strong></p>
<p>Complete and submit one of the two NP-complete problems introduced in last class’s daily:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prove that vertex cover (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{COVER}\)</span>) is NP-complete.</li>
<li>Sipser 7.28. Prove that the card puzzle problem (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{PUZZLE}\)</span>) is NP-complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to prove both parts of the definition of NP-completeness: membership in NP and NP-hardness. Make sure that you also argue both directions of the reduction’s correctness condition.</p>
