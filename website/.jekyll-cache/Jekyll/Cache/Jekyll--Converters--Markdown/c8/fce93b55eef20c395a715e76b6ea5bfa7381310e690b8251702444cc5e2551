<ul>
<li>Sipser, Chapter 8 “Space Complexity” to start of 8.1; 8.2 “The Class PSPACE”</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Reading Problem (Space for Nothing, Time for Free)</strong></p>
<p>The reading proves that while <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{SAT}\)</span> is NP-complete, it only takes a linear amount of space, <em>i.e.</em>, it is in PSPACE. Adapt this proof technique to show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{CLIQUE}\)</span> discussed in the previous chapter is also in PSPACE.</p>
