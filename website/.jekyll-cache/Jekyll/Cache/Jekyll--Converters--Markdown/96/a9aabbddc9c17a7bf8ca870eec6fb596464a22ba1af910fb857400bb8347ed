I"Ç<p>With approximation algorithms, we gain tractability by tolerating answers to optimization problems that are correct but sub-optimal. With probabilistic algorithms we use randomness to try to gain tractability. However, by doing this, our algorithms are correct only with a certain probability value.</p>
