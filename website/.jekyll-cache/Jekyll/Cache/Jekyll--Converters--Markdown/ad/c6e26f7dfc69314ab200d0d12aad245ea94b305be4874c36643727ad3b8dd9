<p>In our exploration of computational models, we‚Äôve moved from relatively limited models‚Äîregular languages‚Äîto more expressive models‚Äîcontext-free languages. You might wonder if there is a model that captures exactly what a modern computer can do. This model is our terminal point in the study of fundamental computational models: the Turing machine. Over the next few days, we‚Äôll learn about this model of computation and analyze it in depth because it is the foundation on which we will build our study of complexity theory.</p>
