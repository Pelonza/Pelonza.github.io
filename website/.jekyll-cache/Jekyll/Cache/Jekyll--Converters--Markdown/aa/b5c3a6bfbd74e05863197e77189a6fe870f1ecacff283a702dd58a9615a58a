<p>Answer the following questions about the fundamental definitions that connect languages, machines, and computation.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do the metavariables <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> traditionally represent? Give a concrete example that covers all three concepts.</li>
<li>What are the <em>types</em> of the five components of a finite automata: <span class="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>?</li>
<li>What does <span class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span> conventionally mean? If <span class="math inline">\(L(M) = A\)</span>, what is the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>?</li>
<li>If we want to <em>prove</em> that “<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> accepts <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>,” what we must we do?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="problem-2-tracing-the-lines">Problem 2: Tracing the Lines</h1>
<p>Consider the following DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>:</p>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><p>Give execution traces, <em>i.e.</em>, the series of states that the DFA steps through on the following input strings. Also state whether <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> accepts the given input string. Make sure to give each of your group members a chance to take the lead in creating these traces.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(01100\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(101101\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(11111\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> (the empty string)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(1010101\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Importantly, we can each think of state of a finite automata as encoding an <em>property</em> about the current computation, <em>i.e.</em>, some property of the set of characters read so far. Based on the traces you wrote above, give an appropriate property for each of <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> <em>solely in terms of the input read so far after arriving at that state</em>, not about the various parts of the DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Using these traces and the properties you wrote down for each state, give a formal description of <span class="math inline">\(L(D)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
