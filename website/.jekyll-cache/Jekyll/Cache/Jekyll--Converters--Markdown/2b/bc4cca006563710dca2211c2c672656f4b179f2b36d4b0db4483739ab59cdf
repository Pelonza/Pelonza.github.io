I"—<p>For the final part of this course, we will explore some advanced topics in the theory of computation. Weâ€™ll begin this journey by briefly studying approximation algorithms which is an alternative style of computation we might employ to gain tractability in the presence of difficult problems, <em>e.g.</em>, NP-complete problems.</p>
