# The Church-Turing Thesis

As Sipser says, we are now at a turning point in the study of the theory of computation.
We have some intuition that a Turing machine is comparable to a general-purpose computer, but is this true?
The *Chuch-Turing Thesis* answers this question in the affirmative, drawing a strong connection between our intuitive notion of algorithm and the formal model studied in this chapter.

## Reading

* Sipser, chapter 3.3 "The Church-Turing Thesis".

**Reading Problem (Review!)**

You should begin review for the upcoming midterm!
As a forcing function towards preparations, please come up with *three questions* regarding the material covered in this first part of the course that we can address in class or in an upcoming mentor session.
