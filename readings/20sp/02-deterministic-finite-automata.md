# Deterministic Finite Automata

We begin our journey into the theory of computation with one of the most elementary models of computation we can consider: the finite automata.
As you read from Sipser, make sure to engage with the reading:

* *Gain intuition* about the model by considering real world examples that can be modeled with finite automata.
* *Explore* the model by coming up with small, artificial examples using the model's formal definition.

## Sipser Reading

Through section 1.1 (Finite Automata)

## Reading Exercise

*(You should complete this reading exercise, add it to your write-up for Friday's daily exercise, and turn in the completed work to Gradescope.)*

* Exercise 1.2 (end of chapter 1).
  You only need to provide the formal description of \\( M_1 \\).
