# Probabilistic Algorithms

With approximation algorithms, we gain tractability by tolerating answers to optimization problems that are correct but sub-optimal.
With probabilistic algorithms we use randomness to try to gain tractability.
However, by doing this, our algorithms are correct only with a certain probability value.

Our study of probabilistic algorithms forms the foundation on which we will discuss quantum computing as the complexity class of efficient probabilistic algorithms BPP is the basis of the class of efficient quantum algorithms, BQP.
