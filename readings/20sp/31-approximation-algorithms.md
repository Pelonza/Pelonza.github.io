# Approximation Algorithms

For the final part of this course, we will explore quantum computation from the perspective of the theory of computation.
By doing so, we hope to understand the real potential of quantum computation to change the world in contrast to popular culture's conception of the topic.

Quantum computing is a technically dense field, cross-cutting between mathematics, computer science, and physics, and is worthy of a course on its own.
Over the next three weeks, we'll take on a pragmatic approach to the subject by building up the core *computational* ideas behind quantum computing, culminating in the BQP complexity class which characterizes tractable computation that can performed with a quantum computer.

We'll begin this journey by briefly studying approximation algorithms which is an alternative style of computation we might employ to gain tractability in the presence of difficult problems, *e.g.*, NP-complete problems.
