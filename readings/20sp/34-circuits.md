# Circuits

The final building block to quantum computation that we will explore are circuits.
Quantum computation is most commonly phrased in terms of circuits, so we will first explore a model of classical computation using circuits and then later this week, extend the model to account for quantum computing.

+ Sipser, chapter 9.3 (Circuit Complexity)
    - Read up to Theorem 9.30 in-depth.
    - Skim Theorem 9.30 to the end of the chapter.
