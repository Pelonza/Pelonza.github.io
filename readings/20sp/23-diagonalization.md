# Diagonalization

On Monday, we talked about decidable language decision problems.
We now develop the machinery to be able to discuss our first undecidable problem: acceptance for Turing machines.

+ Sipser, Chapter 4.2 "Undecidability" to the end of the chapter.
+ [Countability and the Universal Turing Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvQu3jaM8hQ)

# Q&A

> Going over the proof of theorem 4.11 would be nice. (\\( A_\mathsf{TM} \\) is undecidable)

> Diagonalization...

> Is it possible for a problem that was thought to be undecidable to become decidable for some reason? Or is that only possible if a stronger method of computation was found?>
