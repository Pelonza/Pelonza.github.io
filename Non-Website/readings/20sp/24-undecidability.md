# Undecidability

# Q&A

> Why do we only have to prove one direction of this reduction? In other words, do we not need to show that our TM can also reduce to A_TM?

The same reason why we only go in one direction with NP-hardnessâ€”we just need to show that A_tm is upper-bounded by our target problem to establish that the target problem is undecidable.  More generally, there might be "harder" problems that A_tm reduces to (establishing that problem is at least undecidable), but the converse might not be true!

> The book uses the proof by contradiction strategy I outlined in my previous answer. But, why don't we just use the logic "If A is undecidable and reducible to B, then B is undecidable"? For example, to show HALT_tm is undecidable, isn't it just simpler to say that A_tm is undecidable and A_tm reduces to HALT_tm, and so HALT_tm must be undecidable? Or is this faulty logic? 

Nope, that's correct. I outline the relationship between the book's initial reduction proof and the mapping reductions that we used with NP-hardness.  Just like in that situation, we know that if we use a mapping reduction from a NP-hard problem, we know our "to" language is also NP-hard.  So then our proof can focus on the map instead of all the skeleton-stuff around it!

> What about that REGULAR_TM proof?

I'll make a tech video for it and link it above!
