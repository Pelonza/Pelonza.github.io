# Space Complexity

Enough about time, now it's time for spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace.

+ Sipser, Chapter 8 "Space Complexity" to start of 8.1; 8.2 "The Class PSPACE"

**Reading Problem (Space for Nothing, Time for Free)**

The reading proves that while \\( \mathsf{SAT} \\) is NP-complete, it only takes a linear amount of space, *i.e.*, it is in PSPACE.
Adapt this proof technique to show that \\( \mathsf{CLIQUE} \\) discussed in the previous chapter is also in PSPACE.
