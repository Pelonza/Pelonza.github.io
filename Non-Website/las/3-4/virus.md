(Describe the practical ramifications of computational undecidability.)

A _computer virus_ is a computer program that replicates itself on a host machine and spreads to other machines, frequently by exploiting security vulnerabilities in said machines. A virus is frequently not benign; it typically performs some kind of negative behavior alongside replication, _e.g._, encrypting and holding users' files for ransom or stealing data or processing time as with a botnet.

_Antivirus_ software has been developed to combat this threat, and has become an industry of its own. Top antivirus packages receive updates every couple of days so that they can better detect and defeat viruses currently in the wild.

The effort that goes into detecting and cleaning computer viruses is huge. It would be much better if there was some way for us to write a "universal vaccination" program that would detect _any_ possible kind of viral behavior and warn the user.

Use the ideas that we introduced regarding computational undecidability to argue why that such an endeavour---developing the "perfect" antivirus software is practically impossible. Furthermore, describe what computational undecidability tells us we can expect from antivirus software insofar as accuracy goes.
