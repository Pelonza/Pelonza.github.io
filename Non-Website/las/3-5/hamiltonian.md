(Describe practical problem solving strategies for dealing with intractable problems.)

Consider the problem of writing routing software that determines optimal routes for delivery trucks during the holiday. Such a truck needs to know the shortest possible route among a number of delivery destinations such that every destination is delivered once and the truck returns back home. Recall that optimization problems of this sort are $$\mathsf{NP}$$-hard and thus no known algorithm exists to solve this problem efficiently.

Nevertheless, we must persevere! Recalling the three pillars of the intractability problem, choose one of the pillars to compromise on, and describe a high-level strategy to solve this problem with this compromise in mind. Describe the pros and cons of compromising on this pillar and the plausibility of this approach in real life.

(_Note_: I am interested less in whether you pick a "correct" approach and more interested in seeing your rationale and justification based on our discussion of approximation.)
