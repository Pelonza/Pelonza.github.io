(Prove closure and algorithmic properties of the regular languages.)

Let $$\mathsf{starts}(L)$$ be the language of strings drawn from some alphabet $$\Sigma^*$$ where a string of $$L$$ appears at the beginning of each such string of $$\mathsf{starts}(L)$$. Formally:

$$
\mathsf{starts}(L) = \{\, xy \mid x \in L, y \in \Sigma^* \,\}.
$$

Show that if $$L$$ is regular, then $$\mathsf{starts}(L)$$ is also regular. You do not have to give a fully-symbolic proof, but your argument should cover all relevant details of the construction.
