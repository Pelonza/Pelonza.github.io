(Prove closure and algorithmic properties of the regular languages.)

Let $$\mathsf{flip}(L)$$ be the language of strings drawn from alphabet $$\Sigma^* = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$$ such that if $$w \in L$$ then $$w' \in \mathsf{flip}(L)$$ where $$w'$$ is $$w$$ but every $$0$$ is a $$1$$ and every $$1$$ is a $$0$$. For example if $$0100 \in L$$ then $$1011 \in \mathsf{flip}(L)$$.

Show that if $$L$$ is regular, then $$\mathsf{flip}(L)$$ is also regular. You do not have to give a fully-symbolic proof, but your argument should cover all relevant details of the construction.
