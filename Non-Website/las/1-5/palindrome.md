(Represent a problem using a Turing machine.)

Give a (textual) implementation-level description of a TM that recognizes the following language over $$\Sigma = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$$.

$$L = \{\, w \mid w \in \Sigma, \text{\( w \) is a palindrome} \,\}$$.

Recall a string is a _palindrome if $$w = w^R$$, _i.e._, a string is equivalent to its reversal.
