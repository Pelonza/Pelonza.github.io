(Represent a problem using a regular model of computation.)

Give a finite automata (deterministic or non-deterministic) that recognizes the following language over the alphabet $$\Sigma = \{\, 0, 1 \,\}$$:

$$
L = \{\, w \mid \text{\( w \) is an even length string with an odd number of 0s} \,\}.
$$

(_Note_: for this problem, you may upload a diagram of your finite automata or provide it as ASCII art in the textbox below.)
