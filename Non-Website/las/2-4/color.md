(Prove that a problem is in a particular space complexity class.)

Consider the _graph coloring_ problem from a previous demonstration exercise:

$$
\textsf{COLOR} = \{\, (G, k) \mid \text{There is a \( k \)-coloring of graph \( G \)} \,\}
$$

A $$k$$-graph coloring of a graph $$G$$ is an assignment of $$k$$ colors to nodes such that no two nodes share both the same color and an edge.

Show that $$\mathsf{COLOR} \in \mathsf{PSPACE}$$.
