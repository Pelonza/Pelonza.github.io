(Prove that a problem is in a particular space complexity class.)

Consider the _vertex cover_ problem from our discussion of $$\mathsf{NP}$$-completeness:

$$
\textsf{COVER} = \{\, (G, k) \mid \text{Graph \( G \) has a vertex cover of size \( k \)} \,\}
$$

A $$k$$-vertex cover of a graph is a $$k$$-subset of the vertices that cover all the edges of $$G$$.

Show that $$\mathsf{COVER} \in \mathsf{PSPACE}$$.
