(Prove that a problem is in a particular time complexity class.)

A _homomorphism_ between graphs $$G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$$ and $$G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$$ is a function $$h : V_1 \rightarrow V_2$$ between the vertices of the two graphs such that the edges of the graph are preserved. That is, if $$(u, v) \in E_1$$ then $$(h(u), h(v)) \in E_2$$.

Consider the problem of determining _whether there exists a homomorphism_ between two graphs, $$G_1$$ and $$G_2$$. Show that the graph homomorphism problem is in $$\mathsf{NP}$$.
