(Prove closure and algorithmic properties of Turing machines.)

Let a _Right-skip Turing Machine_ (RTM) be a (deterministic) Turing Machine that operates like a normal Turing machine except that when it moves its head to the right, it moves _two_ tape cells instead of just one. A RTM cannot move its tape head a single cell to the right in a single step of computation.

Prove that an RTM is equivalent to a TM. You do not have to give a fully symbolic account of your constructions, but your prose should cover all relevant details.

(_Hint_: make sure to prove both sides of the equivalence! They are _not_ symmetric constructions!)
