\begin{problem}{Representation}
  For each of the following objects, describe a plausible representation for those objects as strings.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item An undirected graph \( G \).
    \item A finite collection of objects \( O_1, \ldots, O_n \), weights for each object \( w_i \), and costs for each object \( c_i \).
    \item An assignment of truth values to a finite collection of boolean variables \( x_1, \ldots, x_k \).
    \item A Turing machine configuration \( C \).
    \item A deterministic finite automata \( D \).
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}{Poly Want A Cracker}
  Show that each of the following languages are in \( P \).
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \( \{\, (\desc{G}, \desc{V'}) \mid \text{\( G = (V, E) \) is a graph, \( V' \subseteq V \) and no two vertices of \( V' \) are incident with each other} \,\} \).
    \item \( \{\, \desc{D} \mid \text{\( D \) is a DFA and \( L(D) = \Sigma^* \)} \,\} \).
    \item \( \{\, \desc{G} \mid \text{\( G \) is a graph and \( G \) contains a triangle (\ie, a 3-clique)} \,\} \).
  \end{enumerate}
