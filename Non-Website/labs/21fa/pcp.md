# Problem: Honey Bunches of Oats


+   (Sipser 5.3) Find a match in the following instance of the Post Correspondence Problem:

    $$
      \left\{ \tile{ab}{abab}, \tile{b}{a}, \tile{aba}{b}, \tile{aa}{a} \right\}.
    $$

+   (Sipser 5.17) Show that the PCP problem is _decidable_ over the unary alphabet $\Sigma = \{\, a \,\}$.

    (_Hint_: With one symbol, you can safely consider the _number_ of symbols on the top and bottom of each tile.
     From there, think about fractions...)
