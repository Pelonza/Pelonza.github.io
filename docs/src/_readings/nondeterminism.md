# Nondeterminism

Next, we explore an interesting extension of finite automata, *nondeterminism*, which allows a machine to *search* multiple possible acceptance paths in parallel.
Nondeterminism has a number of interesting, subtle properties that we'll spend class grasping with the help of Nicolas Cage.

## Sipser Reading

Through section 1.2 (Nondeterminism), stopping at "Equivalence of NFAs and DFAs."

::: exercise
**Reading Problem (Compare and Contrast)**: list the differences in the formal definition of a deterministic finite automata and a nondeterministic finite automata.
Make sure to note not just the differences in the tuple of each machine's components but also the differences in the acceptance conditions of the two models.
