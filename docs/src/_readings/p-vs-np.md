# P vs NP

We'll wrap-up our discussion of NP-Completeness by reviewing the NP-completeness proof technique.
With the time remaining we'll contextualize the [Million Dollar P vs NP Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) before we move onto space complexity!
If you're interested in learning more about the current state of the P vs NP problem, read this excellent overview by theory of computation researcher Scott Aaronson.

+ Scott Aaronson.  $\mathsf{P} \stackrel{?}{=} \mathsf{NP}$.  <https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/pnp.pdf>

**Reading Problem (Reductions Concluded)**

Complete and submit the *other* of the two NP-complete problems introduced in Monday's daily:

1. Prove that vertex cover ($\mathsf{COVER}$) is NP-complete.
2. Sipser 7.28.  Prove that the card puzzle problem ($\mathsf{PUZZLE}$) is NP-complete.

Remember to prove both parts of the definition of NP-completeness: membership in NP and NP-hardness.
Make sure that you also argue both directions of the reduction's correctness condition.
