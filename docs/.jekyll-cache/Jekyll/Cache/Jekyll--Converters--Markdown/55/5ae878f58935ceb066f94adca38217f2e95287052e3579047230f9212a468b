<p>The <em>reverse</em> of a language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(L^R\)</span>, is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
L^R = \{\, x_k \cdots x_1 \mid x_1 \cdots x_k \in L \,\}.
\]</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Give a proof sketch (high-level proof description) that complement is closed under the regular languages. In particular, which language model would you use to prove closure in this case? At a high-level, how do you transform an instance of this model into one that recognizes its reversal?</li>
<li>Formally prove that if <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular, then <span class="math inline">\(L^R\)</span> is also regular.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="problem-complement">Problem: Complement</h1>
<p>The <em>complement</em> of a language is defined to be the set of strings <em>not</em> in the language:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\overline{L} = \{\, w \mid w \notin L \,\}.
\]</span></p>
