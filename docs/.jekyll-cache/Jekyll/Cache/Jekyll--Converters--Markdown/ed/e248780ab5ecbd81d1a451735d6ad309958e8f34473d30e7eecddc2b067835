<p>Now that weâ€™ve reviewed the basics of complexity theory, weâ€™ll jump into the meat of the discussion: NP-Completeness. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}\)</span> asks whether the class of polynomial time problems is equivalent to the class of nondeterministic polynominal time problems. To understand the nature of the problem and why it is so important, weâ€™ll investigate the class <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NP}\)</span> in more detail as well as explore the idea of <em>completeness</em> for a complexity class: problems that define the â€œouter borderâ€ of that class.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sipser 7.3 â€œThe class NPâ€ and 7.4 â€œNP-Completenessâ€ to â€œThe Cook-Levin Theoremâ€.</li>
</ul>

<p>Answer these conceptual questions in a sentence or two a piece.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do we define the class <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NP}\)</span> in terms of a â€œcertificateâ€? How does the â€œcertificateâ€ relate to the â€œnon-determinismâ€ part of <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NP}\)</span>?</li>
<li>How do I show that a language is <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NP}\)</span>-complete?</li>
<li>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A \leq_p B\)</span>. Which of these languages is â€œsolvingâ€ the other? Which of these languages is â€œstrongerâ€ than the other?</li>
</ol>
