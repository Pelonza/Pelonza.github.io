<p>Next, we explore an interesting extension of finite automata, <em>nondeterminism</em>, which allows a machine to <em>search</em> multiple possible acceptance paths in parallel. Nondeterminism has a number of interesting, subtle properties that we’ll spend class grasping with the help of Nicolas Cage.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p><strong>Reading Problem (Compare and Contrast)</strong>: list the differences in the formal definition of a deterministic finite automata and a nondeterministic finite automata. Make sure to note not just the differences in the tuple of each machine’s components but also the differences in the acceptance conditions of the two models.</p>
