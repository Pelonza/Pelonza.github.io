I"l<p>Today, weâ€™ll take a look at closure properties over the regular languages.</p>
<h1 id="sipser-reading">Sipser Reading</h1>
<p>Review the closure proofs for DFAs, NFAs, and regular expressions found between in sections 1.1 to 1.3. These include the proofs that union (1.45), concatenation (1.47), kleene star (1.49) are closed under the regular languages.</p>
