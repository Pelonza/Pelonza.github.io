I"¸<p>With two formal models of computation in-hand, weâ€™ll now talk about two important properties of these models:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <em>equivalence</em> property, stating that, perhaps surprisingly, deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata are equivalent in power!</li>
<li><em>Closure properties</em> that express that certain operations over regular languages, <em>e.g.</em>, language union, produce regular languages as a result.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sipser-reading">Sipser Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>(Re-)read chapter 1.1 â€œThe Regular Operationsâ€ to the end of 1.1.</li>
<li>Read chapter 1.2 â€œEquivalence of NFAs and DFAsâ€ and â€œClosure Under the Regular Operationsâ€ to the end of 1.2.</li>
</ul>
<div class="exercise">
<p><strong>Reading Problem (Restatement)</strong>: closely follow the equivalence of NFA and DFA argument in the reading. Do your best to replicate the proof on your own, minimally referring to the text.</p>
