<p>We’ll wrap-up our discussion of NP-Completeness by reviewing the NP-completeness proof technique. With the time remaining we’ll contextualize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">Million Dollar P vs NP Problem</a> before we move onto space complexity! If you’re interested in learning more about the current state of the P vs NP problem, read this excellent overview by theory of computation researcher Scott Aaronson.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Problem (Reductions Concluded)</strong></p>
<p>Complete and submit the <em>other</em> of the two NP-complete problems introduced in Monday’s daily:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Prove that vertex cover (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{COVER}\)</span>) is NP-complete.</li>
<li>Sipser 7.28. Prove that the card puzzle problem (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{PUZZLE}\)</span>) is NP-complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to prove both parts of the definition of NP-completeness: membership in NP and NP-hardness. Make sure that you also argue both directions of the reduction’s correctness condition.</p>
