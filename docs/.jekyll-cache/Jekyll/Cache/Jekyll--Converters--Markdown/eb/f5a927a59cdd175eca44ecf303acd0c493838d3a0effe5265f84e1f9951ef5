I"²<p>Today, weâ€™ll look at sublinear space complexity, the classes <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{L}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{NL}\)</span>. Curiously enough, we must adjust our model of computation slightly to be able to accurately capture what we mean by â€œless than linear space.â€</p>
