<h1 id="problem-2-scheme-is-real-right">Problem 2: Scheme Is Real, Right?</h1>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Consider the problem of determining whether the branches of an arbitrary if-expression in Scheme, <em>i.e.</em>, a problem of the form <code>(if b e1 e2)</code>, produces the same type of value (<em>e.g.</em>, only integers or strings). For example, this property is:</p>
<ul>
<li>True of <code>(if b 0 1)</code>.</li>
<li>False of <code>(if b 5 #t)</code>.</li>
<li>True of <code>(if b (if #t 0 "hi") 1)</code> (because we are only checking the branches of the top-level conditional).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the content of the guard <code>b</code> in these cases is irrelevant because we want to know whether the types of values of each branch are the same, <em>irrespective of whether we go into either of the branches on any choice of <code>b</code></em>.</p>
<p>Formulate this problem as a language and show that this problem is undecidable. For this problem, you may assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>The existence of a Scheme function <code>run-tm</code> that takes a Turing machine description <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and returns <code>#t</code> if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> accepts <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and <code>#f</code> if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> rejects <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</li>
<li>The ‚Äútype‚Äù of the value ‚Äúproduced‚Äù by the infinite loop is the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù type, <span class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span>. In the context of this proof, <span class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span> has type <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> so that if were able to establish that a branch of computation had type <span class="math inline">\(\bottom\)</span>, that branch has some <em>unknown</em> type <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> that is not necessarily equal to any particular concrete type we have in mind.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now consider the fact that a computer program on a 64-bit machine runs with <span class="math inline">\(2^{64}\)</span> bits of memory. Show that the halting problem for such computer programs is decidable. Make sure to argue the (a) correctness and (b) termination of your algorithm.</p>
<p>(<em>Hint</em>: consider the decidability proof of <span class="math inline">\(A_{\mathsf{LBA}}\)</span>.)</p></li>
<li><p>The answers to the two previous parts seem to be at odds. In a few sentences, describe the critical difference between the two cases that makes the first part undecidable but the second part decidable.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally with all this in mind, it seems like that undecidability is merely a theoretical device. However, it does have important practical implications! In a few sentences, describe these practical implications‚Äîif we feel the need to solve some variant of the halting problem for a computational device, what must we keep in mind and how should we approach the problem?</p></li>
