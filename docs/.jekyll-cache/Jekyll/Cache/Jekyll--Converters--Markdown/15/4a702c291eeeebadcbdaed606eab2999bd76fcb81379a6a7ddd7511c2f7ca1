<p>Consider a Turing machine with <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> states and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> possible tape symbols. Write down an expression for the number of possible configurations of this Turing machine with a tape size of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Explain your expression in a sentence or two.</p>
<h1 id="problem-2-cycles">Problem 2: Cycles</h1>
<p>Prove the following fact regarding halting Turing machines and configurations:</p>
<div class="proof">
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: A Turing machine that halts does not repeat a configuration.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="problem-3-upper-bounds">Problem 3: Upper Bounds</h1>
<p>Observe that if a language is in <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span> then a Turing machine that recognizes it uses a polynomial amount of space. Use your results from the first two problems to prove the following claim:</p>
<div class="proof">
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE} \subseteq \text{EXPTIME}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>(<em>Hint</em>: establish the number of configurations of such a Turing machine and use the previous problemâ€™s claim to establish an upper-bound on the number of steps the Turing machine.)</p>
