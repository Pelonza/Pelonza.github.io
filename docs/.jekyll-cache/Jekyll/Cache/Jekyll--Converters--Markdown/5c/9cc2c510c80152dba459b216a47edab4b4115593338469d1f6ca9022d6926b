<p>This simple text editor supports the entry of Unicode symbols with LaTeX commands. LaTeX commands are parsed and automatically converted into their Unicode equivalents according to <a href="http://milde.users.sourceforge.net/LUCR/Math/">unimathsymbols.txt</a>. It also saves your text to local storage so that it persists between sessions, <em>e.g.</em>, you accidentally close your tab. The implementation is somewhat janky and highly unoptimized—every edit is 𝒪(n)!—so don’t write a book in this or anything.</p>
